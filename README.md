## Strong encryption and low-noise generation
Strong encryption (AES) along with strong hash algo (SHA-512 by default, customizable)

The image encoding process uses a semi-random positional algo to place the bit stream into the piture's items at low-level noise.

## Works for both JPEG and PNG images.
Retrieve your secrets with 2 security factors :
- **Master password** + **Hash algo** (image en/decoding)
- **Data password** (data en/decoding)
